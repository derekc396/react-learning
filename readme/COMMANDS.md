You will need to follow a set of commands to get the app running

1. `npm install` - This installs all your node modules. Located at the `node_modules` directory. Don't dive into that directory as it's a lot of useless information that you don't need right now
2. `npm start` - This starts a dev server that will allow you to view the application in the browser. You can access in browser via localhost:3000. Information about it should also be shown in the console after the command is run. To stop the server, you can hit `control + c`. This server uses what's called hot module reloading. Basically a fancy term that means the app will auto update everytime you save a file. You won't have to refresh your screen

NOTE - you will only have to run npm install when you don't have a `node_modules` directory which should be the first time you run the app or if you delete the directory
